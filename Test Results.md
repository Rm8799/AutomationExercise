- THESE RESULTS WERE COPIED FROM THE PYCHARM TERMINAL AFTER RUNNING THE TEST SUITE.  Progress messages are printed at key steps in each test,
and there is a label with the test name and a confirmation message that it has passed.  Any test failures would print a separate error message,
but there were no failures to report.

- This would ideally be a format that showed simply the total # of failures out of total # of tests run, 
along with the exceptions returned by the failed tests, and then automatically emailed or distributed to relevant parties.
